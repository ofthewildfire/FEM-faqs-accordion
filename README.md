FAQs accordion challenge/ created with just HTML & CSS. Able to be navigated
with keyboard too because of the use of details/summary tags.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I first set up the html/css - right off the bat I knew I was going to use the
`details` and `summary` tags -- however I went down a bit of a rabbit hole with
`position: absolute` -- soon though I scrapped that because I remember a Kevin
Powell video where he mentioned that beginners often have an unhealthy reliance
on `position: absolute` and so in the end I landed up using Grid and a simple
background image set to no-repeat, which works fine for me.

### Continued development

More use of Grid and being more aware of my jump to positioning, I should always
be aware not to use it as a bandaid. Continued practice of the BEM naming
method. I used/tried to use it in this project and I am getting it, but, more
practice is needed.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://www.developer.mozilla.com) - This helped me with the
  details/summary html.
